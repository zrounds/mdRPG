	<h2>JSON Encoding</h2>
	<p>The Json encodings encapsulate all the data for any given 
		instance of a table as an array of all its fields. The keys are all 
		strings with names similar if not equal to the names of their corresponding 
		fields. The values are all either strings or integers.
	</p>

	 <h3>URL Types: </h3>

	<h4><em>GET Methods:</em></h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Read</li> 
			<ul>
				<li>
					Default behaviour of GET method; requires a parameter named "ObjectType" set to one of our 3 ORM classes
					and the unique ID of the desired resource as extra path info. It returns a json encoded array of all of the 
					fields of the appropriate table as a public call to the correct ORM object.					
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		
		<ul><li>Delete</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Same requirements as Read, except an additional parameter named "delete" must be set to any value. Uses the 
					automatic read that happens to create an ORM instantiation of the desired object and calls its internal delete method 
					that removes the associated DB row and removes itself from memory as an object. The segment containing the check 
					for "delete" will never be reached unless an object of the desired ID has already been read through the automatic 
					call to read. This method returns true to the ajax call upon success. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<h4><em>POST Methods:</em></h4>
		<ul><li>Create</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Requires a parameter "create" to be set to anything, "ObjectType" to be specified, and then every field of each specific 
					element to be set in $_POST to an appropriate value for its type which are then sanitized, excluding the unique ID that 
					will be calculated by finding the max id currently in the table and adding 1 to it. Though auto_increment would allow us 
					to default to one and allow the DB to correct the index as needed, if an associated piece of the primary key (i.e. SID 
					and initialLocation in Stories) has a reuse of the non-arbitrary value (i.e. initialLocation), an error will be thrown by 
					the DB before the index is corrected and thus the entry has a distinct primary key; the correct id is thus calculated 
					manually so that an otherwise valid input is not stopped by this unfortunate ordering of the database's logic. 
					This method then instantiates the values submitted as an ORM object once the insert successfully completes and is 
					returned as a json encoded array of all of its fields of with a public call to the correct ORM object.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>	
		<ul><li>Update</li>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Requires a parameter "update" to be set to anything, "ObjectType" to be specified, and the unique ID of the desired resource. 
					It then it finds the object through a call to the ORM, it will call the public setters for any of that object's fields which 
					have been set in $_POST (i.e. $_POST['title'] for Story) which are checked to be appropriate for their type and then sanitized 
					as in Create. After all of the updates have been made to the ORM object (which updates the values in the database implicitly), 
					a json encoded array of all of the values for the fields is returned, reflecting any changes made during the update process. 
				</li>
			</ul>
		</ul>
